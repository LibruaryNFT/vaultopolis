Summary of Key Contracts for Creating and Managing Your Liquidity Pool

1. SwapFactory Contract
   Purpose:
   The SwapFactory contract is used to create new liquidity pools (pairs) between two tokens.

Steps to Use:

Create the Liquidity Pool:
Call the createPair function on the SwapFactory contract.
Specify the vaults for $TSHOT and $stFlow.
This function will deploy a new SwapPair contract specific to the $TSHOT/$stFlow pair. 2. SwapPair Contract
Purpose:
The SwapPair contract manages the specific liquidity pool for your token pair. It handles adding/removing liquidity and processing swaps.

Steps to Use:

Add Initial Liquidity:
Once the pair is created, interact with the SwapPair contract.
Use the addLiquidity function to deposit your initial $2,500 worth of $TSHOT and $stFlow tokens into the pool.
Manage the Pool:
You can use the removeLiquidity function to withdraw liquidity.
The swap function allows tokens to be exchanged between $TSHOT and $stFlow within the pool.
How It Works:
Creation: SwapFactory creates a SwapPair contract for your chosen tokens.
Management: SwapPair handles the day-to-day operations of the liquidity pool, including liquidity management and swaps.
Note: You donâ€™t need to interact with SwapRouter or SwapConfig directly; they are used internally to support advanced swap functionalities.

Increment.FI only allows for basic swap functionality, so you will primarily interact with the SwapPair contract to manage your liquidity pool.
